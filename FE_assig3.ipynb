    "\"\"\"Data encoding refers to the process of converting data from one format or representation to another. It is a fundamental concept in data science and plays a crucial role in\n",
    "preparing data for analysis, modeling, and other tasks. Data encoding is useful in data science for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical Data Handling: In many real-world datasets, categorical data (such as text or labels) is prevalent. Data encoding allows you to convert these categorical values into \n",
    "numerical representations that machine learning algorithms can work with. Common encoding techniques include one-hot encoding and label encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization and Standardization: Data encoding is often used to normalize or standardize numerical features. This ensures that features have similar scales, preventing some\n",
    "features from dominating the analysis due to their magnitude. Min-Max scaling and Z-score normalization are common encoding methods for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality Reduction: Encoding can also be used for dimensionality reduction. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transform data into a lower-dimensional space, \n",
    "capturing the most essential information while reducing the number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Data Processing: In natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis, data encoding is essential for converting text data into numerical representations. Techniques like\n",
    "word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe) convert words or phrases into dense vectors that machine learning models can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient Storage and Transmission: Data encoding can be used to reduce the size of data, making it more efficient to store and transmit. For example, encoding techniques like \n",
    "Huffman coding can compress text data for efficient storage and transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Security: Encoding can be used for data security and privacy. Techniques like data masking or encryption can be applied to protect sensitive information while allowing it \n",
    "to be stored and transmitted securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering: In feature engineering, data encoding plays a significant role. Engineers create new features by encoding information from existing ones. For example, extracting\n",
    "the day of the week from a date feature or creating interaction terms are forms of feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning Model Input: Machine learning models require numerical input. Data encoding is necessary to convert raw data into a format that can be used as input for predictive \n",
    "models.\"\"\""

    "Nominal encoding, also known as categorical encoding, is a data encoding technique used to convert categorical data or nominal data (data with no intrinsic order or ranking)\n",
